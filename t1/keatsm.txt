KNOWING within myself the manner in which this Poem has been
produced, it is not without a feeling of regret that I make it public.
What manner I mean, will be quite clear to the reader, who must soon
perceive great inexperience, immaturity, and every error denoting a
feverish attempt, rather than a deed accomplished. The two first
books, and indeed the two last, I feel sensible are not of such
completion as to warrant their passing the press; nor should they if I
thought a year's castigation would do them any good;- it will not: the
foundations are too sandy. It is just that this youngster should die
away: a sad thought for me, if I had not some hope that while it is
dwindling I may be plotting, and fitting myself for verses fit to
live.
